Docusaurus configuration for Nefino LI docs
==============================

This repository bundles all the configuration files for https://docusaurus.io/. Following this [discussion](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/discussions/6086) on Github, the Nefino LI docs are organized as a portal. The repository is added as a git submodule to all repos where documentation is added alongside its code. Check out the docs in the ``nefino_li`` repository for more information about the portal structure and how to write docs.
